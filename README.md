Inspired by traditional flashcards and Quizlet 

The purpose of the software, or the website, was to create a way for people to test out vocabulary on a class project. It's meant to be my "stepping stone" into web dev, and yes, I'm already a little bit experienced in web dev. Also, don't copy the code. I'm fine with anyone copying and pasting (I mean, it's open source for a reason), but I didn't *design* for the code to be copied and pasted. The project was made possible using React. I also do know that the <code>create-react-app</code> is kind of deprecated now, and I do plan to switch onto a more supported React setup thingy, but I mean... it worked so no harm done, right? Right? Anyways, I hope you have a fantastic day!
